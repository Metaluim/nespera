# What's this

This will be an implementation from scratch of a NES emulator, hopefully with
enough reusable code for implementing emulators of other systems.

# Why are you doing this

1. Some leftover time with mandatory quarantine of COVID-19
2. I wanted to try my hand in emulating hardware and reproducing peculiar
hardware behaviour
3. I wanted to this without resorting to any material, except the documentation
available over at wiki.nesdev.com
3.1. I imposed this restriction on myself to force me to think and come up with
solutions on my own
4. This is merely a toy-project but hopefully the codebase will be simple enough
that someone may want to play around and/or learn with it
5. Last but least, I'll try to sharpen my modern C++ chops with this, trying the
new features available with the more recent standards of C++
